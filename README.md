# **CS431 Course Project: Design and Implementation of a RAG-based QA System**

> This repository contains the implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Question Answering System**, developed as the final project for **CS431.Q22 – Deep Learning and Applications** at the **University of Information Technology (UIT – VNU-HCM)**.
>
> The project focuses on building an intelligent Q&A system for lecture videos, integrating **YouTube transcript extraction, Whisper ASR, advanced preprocessing, recursive + semantic chunking, hybrid search (BM25 + vector search), and cross-encoder reranking**.  
>
> The primary objective of this project is to **design and implement a robust RAG-based pipeline** that delivers accurate, context-grounded answers with transparent citations and timestamp-based deep links, supporting self-learning and knowledge retrieval for students.
>
> The project emphasizes **data processing workflow design, retrieval optimization, and orchestration with LangGraph**, rather than solely maximizing LLM output quality.
